      <h2>Solo and Ensemble</h2>
      <p>Solo and Ensemble is is an event where individual students and/or groups of students perform prepared music for a judge and are rated on a score of 1 to 5, with one being the best. ... students participated in S&E this year, and ALL participants from Madison recieved either a 1 or a 2 for their music. Participants who recieved a 2 are... participants who recieved a 1 are... . Madison is very proud of our band students who recieved these great scores.</p>
      <h2>All West</h2>
      <p>All West, which is an event put on by the West Tennesee School Band and Orchestra Association (WTSBOA), is a huge honor to be a part of. This honor band encompasses all of West Tennessee, and only the best players get to be a part of this experience, with each player required to prepare the given audition  music, which can take months to perfect. Adde on to the audition music, each play must be able to play all 12 major scales on their instrument, and be able to perform sight reading, or playing a piece pf music without ever having seen it. Once a student is accepted for All West, they will attend the All West convention, which is a weekend event where they meet with the other players who were accepted, and have a few days of rehearsal together, and then perform as a group. This past year at Madison, we had 6 Madison students make All West for band. The students for the 2017-2018 school year that attendeed All West were Senior Maria Salsetto (clarinet), Juniors Morgan Collier (flute) and Ismael Silvar (trumpet), Sophmore Jesse Veltman (trumpet), and Freshmen Amber Martin (clarinet) and Skyler Perkins (clarinet). Please congratulate these students for their accomplishment.</p>
      <h2>All State</h2>
      <p>All State is an honor band that is an even greater honor than All West. The top players from the All West bands, as well as the top players from the Middle Tennessee and East Tennessee honor bands, are accepted into All State. In reality, when a student auditions for All West, they really are auditioning both for All West and All State. This is an amazing achievement, as this honor is only given to the absolute best of the best in Tennessee. We had (number) students make All State this year, and they are.... Please acknowledge these students for their achievement. </p>
      <h2>Concert Festival</h2>
      <p>Concert Festival is an event that happens in a local city in each district every year. Bands from the area travel to this Festival to play for a panel of judges and recieve a score. They are required to play 2 prepared pieces, one having to be a march, and a sightreading piece.  Bands are rated on a score of 1 to 5, with one being the best and 5 being the worst, in each category, ending up with an average of all the scores. For the 2017-2018 school year, the Madison Academic Band recieved a 1 in every single category, giving them a perfect score. The Madison Band was one of only 2 bands in West Tennessee to achieve this feat.</p>
      <h2>State Concert Festival</h2>
      <p>State Concert Festival...</p>
      <h2>Jackson Symphony Youth Orchestra</h2>
      <p>The Jackson Symphony Youth Orchestra (JSYO) is a local organization in Jackson, Tennessee put on by the Jackson Symphony. This organization allows players who audition to play with other local players their age, as well as a concert in conjunction with the Jackson Symphony itself. The audition process requires a given piece of audition music, a piece chosen by the participant, a sightreading piece, and knowledge of all 12 major scales. This year, we have had 7 students from the Madison Band that were accepted into this organization. The students who are a part of this organization in the 2018-2019 school year are Seniors Madison Webb (clarinet), Katie Wilson (flute), Eboni ... (oboe), and Ismael Silvar (trumpet), Juniors Josaih Nodurft (oboe) and Joseph Curtin (trumpet), and Sophmore Amber Martin (bass clarinet). </p>
